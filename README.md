# HYPRFIT - Next.js Project

This project is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a powerful React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation. The project was initialized using [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app), providing a solid foundation for development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Before running the application, ensure you have installed all required dependencies. In the project root directory, run:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
# or
bun install
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Development Server
Once dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

By default, the application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Open this URL in your browser to view the project.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The key components of the project are structured as follows:

- **Frontend:** Built using **Next.js** with **TypeScript** and styled using **SCSS**.
- **Backend:** A **Flask** server handles data processing and API endpoints.
- **Machine Learning:** Uses **Jupyter (Python)** for computations and model training.
- **Recommendations Engine:** Implements **LLaMA** (a local AI model) to generate recommendations dynamically.
- **UI/Visualization:** Utilizes **Streamlit** to display results interactively.

## üîç Features

- **Next.js Powered UI:** A dynamic and responsive frontend built using the React-based Next.js framework.
- **Flask Backend:** Handles API requests and communicates with the machine-learning models.
- **Local AI Recommendations:** Uses LLaMA to generate intelligent recommendations locally.
- **Streamlit Dashboard:** Provides a user-friendly interface for viewing generated insights.
- **SCSS Styling:** For better UI customization and maintainability.

## üõ† Development & Customization

### Editing Pages
All the main UI components and logic reside in the `app/page.tsx` file. Any modifications to this file will be reflected in real-time while the server is running.

### Running Jupyter Notebooks
Since the project leverages Jupyter for some ML tasks, ensure you have Jupyter installed and running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, navigate to the relevant notebook to execute any computations.

### Flask API
To run the backend Flask server, navigate to the backend directory and execute:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will start the backend server, allowing the frontend to fetch data from it.

## üöÄ Deployment

This project is currently designed to run locally. However, if you wish to deploy it, you can explore hosting solutions such as:

- **Vercel** (For deploying the Next.js frontend)
- **Render or DigitalOcean** (For deploying the Flask backend)
- **Local Server or Cloud VM** (For running Jupyter and Streamlit)

## ü§ù Contributing

Since this project is locally deployed, contributions and modifications are encouraged to enhance functionality. Feel free to fork the repository and experiment with improvements.
